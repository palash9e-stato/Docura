# Docura

_Docura_ is a lightweight PDF-RAG agent built with n8n that turns any PDF into an interactive, conversational knowledge source. When you upload a document to _Google Drive_, _Docura_ extracts the text, cleans it, chunks it, generates embeddings, and stores them in both your local n8n database and _Pinecone_ for fast vector search. A separate chat workflow embeds your questions, retrieves the most relevant chunks, and uses an AI model to deliver accurate, context-grounded answers. Together, these workflows let you quickly and reliably chat with your PDFs and extract meaningful insights from them.
